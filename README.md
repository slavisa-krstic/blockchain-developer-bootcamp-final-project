Consensys Academy - Blockchain developer bootcamp final project - Slavisa Krstic

# Idea
Idea of the final project is to create "Guess the Number" dapp is a fun educational game that challenges kids to find a number based on greater than or less than feedback. One player set the number and rules for other player to guess the number and receive reword. Player that is guessing the number have 3 shots to guess a right number. Based on number of guesses tries, player will receive proper reword.

# More about the game
Guess the number is simple game. Owner of the games set numbers and the players can start guessing. For players to be able to play the game owner must create more the 5 games. In that way there is no way for player to predict number and guess them based on a data inside the contract. Players can see number of winnings and losses.
